* save_chunk etc. must handle getting a metadata file that should be merged rather than store as a canonical file.

----------

+ i kinda super hate python. just so you know.
    + no, really!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	
+ rewrite it all.
	+ in a better language.
	+ with static type checking.
	+ especially for date/times.
	+ especially for string encodings end-to-end.
	+ let alone every input/output.
	
+ don't crawl some directories by default:
  + .hg
  + .git
  + mac os x Library
  + browser caches
  + temp/tmp dirs?

+ fix re-crawling old pybak data, merge or skip properly.

+ fix up handling of unhexlifyable bytes/strings.

+ fix java to not injest things where metadata path is in 'canonical'.
+ use a typed language for metadata for clear vs. hexl paths.
+ filepath parts is not right; often not split.
+ migrate all metadata to version 10.
+ assert expected mdj
  + hexl file paths, not clear.
  + file path parts.

+ metadata should include file date from source hosts.
	+ oh it might already. not sure we consume it well everywhere e.g. images by date.

----------

+ pysonar2.
+ split up file paths on client side.
  + figure out how it should work on windows.
  + presumably path_to_list() root-base case's aren't right for windows!
+ make sure path is done right relatively.

* note that character encoding was never handled well,
so if things work it is mostly by dumb luck. for example,
the postgres db (luckly?) defaulted to utf-8.

* fix command line argument parsing; use a real library!

+ put the .ext on the canonical file instead.
+ support deleting things from the browse-name view.
+ fix sheets in various ways.
+ maybe do things lazily instead e.g. sheets.

* delete metadata if there's no matching canonical.
* sheets should be jpgs and should make big jpgs behind them?
  	* uhg, at least show filenames in sheets.
  	* is there an equivalent jpg for nef?
	* can't tell unless original file names preserved.
	* so my import rename hack should be an extn, not total rename.
* nefs aren't supported in browsers.
* finding all movies, all photos.
* uploading, diffing.

* really, fix up argument parsing.
* fix argument parsing to die if there's unknowns like misspelled things.
	* e.g. somebody writes "--max-epth"

* aka bugs:
	* listing breaks on things in root.
	* not showing everything that was in metadata?
* gui support for deleting things with are you really sure?
* fix argument parsing to die if there's unknowns like misspelled things.
	* e.g. somebody writes "--max-epth"
* a wx gui.
* streaming tar file generation for downloading from browse.
* streaming tar file generation.
